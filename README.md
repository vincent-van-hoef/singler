### SingleR

SingleR is a tool to automatically annotate single cells by correlating per cell gene expression to reference gene expression databases. SingleR was developed by Dvir Aran and more info can be found [here](https://github.com/dviraran/SingleR). This works on both mouse and human data. The code should also work for large objects by splitting the initial seurat object in chunks of 10000 cells and reassembling the annotations at the end (NOTE this takes a while though...).
